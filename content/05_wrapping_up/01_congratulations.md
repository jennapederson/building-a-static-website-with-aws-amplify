- The basics of HTML layouts
- How to add some simple CSS styling
- How to make your page interactive with JavaScript

- How to make updates to your deployed website

### Challenge Yourself

Want to take it to the next level?

- [Connect a custom domain to your site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html). To do this, you'll need your own AWS account, not a temporary account.
- Grab a pre-built template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) like this one [here](https://html5up.net/phantom) and get started quickly
- Create a Git repository with your website code and [continuously build, deploy, and host your site with AWS Amplify Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)

Let's do some clean up in your AWS account.
