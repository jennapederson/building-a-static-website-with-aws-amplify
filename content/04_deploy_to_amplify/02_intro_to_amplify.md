AWS Amplify is one of the services we can interact with in the AWS Management Console. We'll use the Amplify Console to host our website so the world can see it.

AWS Amplify enables web and mobile developers to build and deploy secure, scalable full-stack applications. With Amplify, you can quickly create a backend with cloud resources such as GraphQL, REST APIs, authentication, file, and data storage and then connect it with your frontend code.

With the Amplify Console, you can deploy and host a static website, manage production and test environments, set up continuous deployment, connect your custom domain to your site, and even see how your site is rendered on different devices.

Let's deploy our site!
