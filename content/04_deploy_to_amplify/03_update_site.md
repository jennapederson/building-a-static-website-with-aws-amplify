### Update Your Site

If you need to update your website's files or publish a new blog post, you can make your changes to your site locally and test it in your browser. Once you know your updates work correctly and everything looks right, you can then upload your updated website files to AWS Amplify.

You'll create an updated zip file of the contents of the `website` folder (not of the folder itself) and drag and drop it to the AWS Amplify Console to update your site.
