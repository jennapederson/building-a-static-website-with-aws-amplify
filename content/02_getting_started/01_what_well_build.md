### Our Goal

We'll build a static website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll use the AWS Amplify Console to host the static resources for the website.

The workshop is divided into six parts. You will:

- create your first web page with HTML
- style it with CSS
- make it more interactive with JavaScript
- use the AWS Amplify Console to host your website
- create your first blog post
- and update your live website on AWS Amplify

### The architecture

The architecture for this module is very straightforward. All of your static web content including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and other files will be managed by AWS Amplify Console and served via Amazon CloudFront. Your end users will then access your site using the public website URL exposed by AWS Amplify Console. You donâ€™t need to run any web servers or use other services in order to make your site available to the public. We'll use the services and tools AWS provides to handle the heavy lifting involved in building modern, robust applications.
